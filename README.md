Multi-Disease Prediction and Health Recommendation System 🧑‍⚕️

Welcome to the Multi-Disease Prediction and Health Recommendation System, a web application that leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Breast Cancer. Using trained models and user-provided medical data, the system not only predicts disease presence but also generates personalized health reports with actionable advice using the Hugging Face Inference API. Built with Streamlit, this tool is user-friendly and designed for educational purposes.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This application is for educational purposes only. Predictions and reports are not definitive diagnoses. Always consult a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.


🌟 Features

Multi-Disease Prediction:
Predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Breast Cancer.
Uses pre-trained machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM) for accurate predictions.


Personalized Health Reports:
Generates detailed health reports using Hugging Face's Mixtral-8x7B model.
Provides actionable steps, focus areas, and precautions for disease management, or healthy living tips if no disease is predicted.


Interactive Interface:
Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
Sidebar navigation for easy access to different prediction pages.


Robust Error Handling:
Validates user inputs and handles API errors gracefully.


Timestamped Reports:
Health reports include a timestamp for reference (e.g., "Generated on 04:22 PM IST, Tuesday, May 13, 2025").


🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
A Hugging Face API token (for generating health reports)

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-disease-prediction.git
cd multi-disease-prediction


Install Dependencies:Ensure you have the required packages installed. Use the provided requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt includes:

streamlit
streamlit-option-menu
huggingface_hub
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn


Set Up Hugging Face API Token:

Create a .streamlit/secrets.toml file in the project root.
Add your Hugging Face API token:HF_API_TOKEN = "your_huggingface_api_token"


Get your token from Hugging Face.


Download Pre-trained Models:

The saved_models/ directory should contain the following pre-trained models:
diabetes_model.sav
heart_disease_model.sav
parkinsons_model.sav
breast_cancer_model.sav


If these models are missing, you can train them using the notebooks in colab_files_to_train_models/. See the Training Models section for details.

Running the Application

Start the Streamlit App:
streamlit run app.py

This will launch the app in your default web browser (typically at http://localhost:8501).

Navigate the App:

Use the sidebar to select a prediction page (e.g., "Diabetes Prediction").
Enter the required medical parameters in the input fields.
Click the "Test Result" button to view the prediction and health report.


📖 Usage

Home Page:

Overview of the application and instructions on how to use it.
Includes a disclaimer about the educational nature of the tool.


Prediction Pages:

Diabetes Prediction: Input parameters like Pregnancies, Glucose, BMI, etc.
Heart Disease Prediction: Input parameters like Age, Sex, Cholesterol, etc.
Parkinson's Prediction: Input vocal and motor-related metrics (e.g., MDVP:Fo(Hz), Jitter).
Breast Cancer Prediction: Input tumor metrics (e.g., Mean Radius, Worst Texture).
Each page provides a prediction (e.g., "The person is diabetic") and a generated health report.


Health Reports:

If a disease is predicted, the report includes:
A summary of the diagnosis.
Actionable Steps: Lifestyle changes or recommendations.
Focus Areas: Key health aspects to monitor.
Precautions: Steps to prevent worsening the condition.


If no disease is predicted, the report includes:
A confirmation of good health.
Healthy Living Tips: General wellness advice.
Wellness Recommendations: Practices for long-term health.

🛠️ Training Models
The pre-trained models in saved_models/ were trained using scikit-learn (version 1.0.2). To retrain or create new models:

Access the Notebooks:

Navigate to colab_files_to_train_models/.
Open the relevant notebook (e.g., diabetes_model_training.ipynb).

Prepare the Data:

Datasets are stored in dataset/.
Ensure you have the required datasets (e.g., diabetes.csv, heart.csv).


Train the Models:

The notebooks use scikit-learn models like LogisticRegression and SVM.
Example training process:from sklearn.svm import SVC
import pandas as pd
import pickle

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('dataset/diabetes.csv')
X = data.drop('Outcome', axis=1)
y = data['Outcome']

# Train model
model = SVC()
model.fit(X, y)

# Save model
with open('saved_models/diabetes_model.sav', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)

Repeat for each disease model.

Update the App:

Ensure the new models are placed in saved_models/ and match the expected filenames.


Note: The app currently uses scikit-learn 1.5.1, which may cause version mismatch warnings with models trained on 1.0.2. Retraining with 1.5.1 is recommended for compatibility.
